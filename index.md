## About Me

I obtained my bachelor's degree in <a href="https://jwc.gdou.edu.cn/info/1214/6508.htm" target="_blank"> Electrical Engineering and Automation </a> from <a href="https://www.gdou.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Guangdong Ocean University </a> in 2023. During my college years, I was a founding member of the Power Conversion Innovation Team in the College of Electrical and Information Engineering, mentored by Prof. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086852741" target="_blank"> Peng Luo</a>, who received his Ph.D. in 2023 from <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276172100" target="_blank"> National Cheng Kung University</a> in Taiwan.

<!--
At the end of 2021, I began researching energy storage for renewable energy and power converters in power electronics. Despite a busy schedule during my junior year, I managed to develop three projects of power converters and produce over ten PCB boards. 
In terms of academia: Three SCI, one EI Conference, and one utility model patent were accepted and published. 
In terms of competition: As team leader, I led my team to win a <a href="https://www.gdou.edu.cn/info/1092/46051.htm" target="_blank"> first prize</a> in a national-level competition. 
In terms of academic performance: Despite ranking 1/ 147 in my major during my junior year, due to an error, I failed one subject. Although I subsequently passed the makeup exam, I consequently lost the eligibility for graduate school recommendation.

After graduation, I worked as a hardware engineer at <a href="https://www.shineyoung.com/" target="_blank"> Shenzhen Shineyoung New Energy Technology Co., Ltd.</a>. Due to my consistent delivery of high-quality work within deadlines, I was promoted to an important project team and received an A in my probationary evaluation.

Due to our shared passion for power electronics and our future plans, my fiancée, Jie He, and I are applying full-time to the 2025FALL PhD program in the United States.

Outside of academia, fitness, sea fishing and cooking are my hobbies, and I'm also an amateur DJ available for parties.
